## Project Description:
A Python package named "DataPrepKit." This package have a series of functions that assist in reading data from a variety of file formats, summarizing datasets, managing missing values, and encoding categorical data.

## Key Features:

1. Data Reading:
- Objective: Implement functions that can read data from different file formats such as CSV, Excel, and JSON.

2. Data Summary:
- Objective: Develop functions to print key statistical summaries of the data, including metrics like the average and most frequent values.
- 
3. Handling Missing Values:
- Objective: Create functions for addressing missing values, offering solutions to either remove or impute them based on set strategies.

4. Categorical Data Encoding:
- Objective: Design functions for encoding categorical data, allowing their conversion into numerical formats for analysis.
